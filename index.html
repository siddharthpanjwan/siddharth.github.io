<p>Communication is the heart and soul of the human experience. The process communication mainly includes  speaking , listening, and writing. Nobody actually learns grammar to learn his/ her own mother tongue. It is a natural phenomenon that we start speaking what everybody speaks around us. We gradually develop a better sense of understanding with the passage of time.</p>
<p>We don't study grammar of our own mother tongue to use it  for daily speaking, but when we need to polish our own mother tongue, we have to study its grammar and we usually do that. When we come to learning  a new language like English language, we need to study  its grammar, the importance of grammar cannot be neglected and before we do that we need to understand what grammar is.</p>
<p>Grammar is the study of words and the ways words work together. An invisible force that guides us as we put words together into sentences. Any person who communicates using a particular language is consciously or unconsciously aware of the grammar of that  language.</p>
<p>To speak in a clearer and more effective manner we study grammar. A person who has unconscious knowledge of grammar may be sufficient for simple language use, but the ones who wish to communicate in an artful manner and well, will seek greater depth of understanding and proficiency that the study of grammar provides</p>
