Adjectives describe or give information about nouns or pronouns.
</p><font  color="Purple">
For example:-</font>
<p>
The grey dog barked. (The adjective grey describes the noun "dog".</p>
<p>
The good news is that the form of an adjective does not change. It does not matter if the noun being modified is male or female, singular or plural, subject or object.
</p><p>
Some adjectives give us factual information about the noun - age, size colour etc (fact adjectives - can't be argued with). Some adjectives show what somebody thinks about something or somebody - nice, horrid, beautiful etc (opinion adjectives - not everyone may agree).
</p><p>
If you are asked questions with which, whose, what kind, or how many, you need an adjective to be able to answer.

There are different types of adjectives in the English language:
